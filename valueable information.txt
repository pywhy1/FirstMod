some stuff will go here later
this is just to get rid of the excess comments in my code
ctrl+f to find specific functionalities of certain functions
use libresprite for spriting and such operations

IMPORTANT: NEVER name file folder names the same as terraria classes like Item, GenPass, And Tile. This will cause conflicts in your code.








.AddIngredient(ItemID.Wood, 10) Adds ingredient of any type

Item.useTime = 40; frames until completed swing

Item.DamageType = DamageClass.Melee; this sets the damage type to melee

Item.knockBack = 10f; f is for float in C sharp, this sets the knockback on the item

Item.crit = 10; % chance for a crit

ItemID.Sets.SortingPriorityMaterials[Type] = 48; sorting priority determines where the item should be placed when you click the 'sort' button in the inventory

Item.createTile = ModContent.TileType<Tiles.SkulkOre>(); createTile takes in the TileID that will be created. a modded tile can be acquired through ModContent. a namespace leading to the 
class in the parameters can be added or just adding the namespace in works

TileID.Sets.Ore[Type] = true; TileID.Sets contains groups of tiles that share some things in common, like the trait of being an ore. We will be adding our tile to the ore set.

Main.tileSolid[Type] = true; Main.tileSolid will tell us if the tile has colision enabled or not. You would disable this for a furniture like the Clock.

Main.tileMergeDirt[Type] = true; The ore texture has have frames that merge with dirt blocks, so this is set to true.

Main.tileBlockLight[Type] = true; this blocks light from passing through the block

Main.tileShine[Type] = 900; the frequency dust particles will emit from this block, the higher the value the less frequent

Main.tileShine2[Type] = true; handles some of the drawing for the tile, research this for more clarity

Main.tileSpelunker[Type] = true; shines from spelunker pot

Main.tileOreFinderPriority[Type] = 350; basically sets the value for the metal detector and its variants, so that it may show up instead of lower level ores, for example gold instead of copper
350 is right above platinum

AddMapEntry(new Color(2, 66, 215), CreateMapEntryName()); 2 parameters are passed here: the color that will appear on your map and the "key" that is used to display the name of the tile. 
                                                  The key parameter is optional.
                                                CreateMapEntryName is the method that gets the "key" based on the mod name, class name, and object type. They key, in this case, will be:
                                                Mod.FirstMod.MapObject.SkulkOre

DustType = DustID.Tungsten; can be set to vanilla IDs for dust type, but I THINK it just sets the sparkle of the ore

ItemDrop = ModContent.ItemType<Items.Placeables.YOUROREHERE> ItemDrop sets what item will drop after being destroyed. We set this value to the ItemID that we want to spawn. For more than one item,
which is The default, refer to ()

SoundType = SoundID.Tink; SoundType sets what sound will play when someone hits the tile with a pickaxe. (THIS IS NOT CORRECT, REMOVE THIS WHEN THIS HAS BEEN EDITED)

MineResist = 1.5f; this sets how long it takes to break the tile

MinPick = 60; this determines minimum pickaxe power needed to break the tile

Item.createTile = ModContent.TileType<Tiles(or path to the file).FILE_WITH_YOUR_CUSTOM_BARS>(); this tile being created CAN be used by all custom bar classes. Any bar made later on will use this tile.

Item.placeStyle = 0; placeStyle will determine the "frame" that is going to be placed. You can see a good example of this in the terraria vanilla textures files. This texture will contain
            //multiple bars in a line, set next to each other, in a process called padding. https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Spriting#padding 
            //0 is frame 1, 1 is frame 2, and so on.

Main.tileSolidTop[Type] = true; this will make the top of the tile solid, and ONLY the top solid. Acting like a platform.

Main.tileFrameImportant[Type] = true; this is required for tiles that will not use the conventional textures. Used for custom bars and furniture. By setting this to true we are saying
that we will handle things differently than the game.

TileObjectData.newTile.CopyFrom(TileObjectData.Style1x1); because it is a special tile, the TileObjectData has to be accessed, and a few settings must be set.
we can copy an existing style, in this case, we will copy from the 1x1 style.

AddMapEntry(new Color(200, 200, 200), Language.GetText("MapObject.MetalBar")); because this tile contains multiple tiles, a shared name must be given. The vanilla value for Bars will be retrieved here.
This is also called a language key.

TileObjectData.newTile.StyleHorizontal = true; this texture is a horizontal strip so TileObjectData must be set to recognise this. setting this to true does this.

TileObjectData.newTile.LavaDeath = false; This prevents the tile from being destroyed on contact with lava.

TileObjectData.addTile(Type); This applys the tile to the TileObjectData, and this is done by passing Type into addTile()


Here are some of the most commonly used fields and properties of the Projectile class in Terraria:

    ai[0]: This index is typically used to track the current state of the projectile, such as how long it has been alive or how many times
    it has bounced off a surface. In the code you provided earlier, this index is used to count how many times the projectile's AI() method has been called.

    ai[1]: This index is often used to store a timer value, such as how long the projectile should remain active before despawning or performing
    some other action. For example, a projectile that explodes on impact might use this index to count down the time until it explodes.

    In the end, Projectile.ai[] is used to store values for a particular projectile. It is not pre defined.

    projectile.position: A Vector2 that represents the current position of the projectile in the game world.
    projectile.velocity: A Vector2 that represents the current velocity of the projectile in the game world. You can modify this to control the projectile's movement.
    projectile.ai: An array of floats that you can use to store custom data about the projectile. The ai array has a length of 3 by default, but you can increase this if you need more storage space.
    projectile.damage: An integer that represents the amount of damage the projectile deals to enemies that it hits.
    projectile.knockBack: A float that represents the amount of knockback that the projectile applies to enemies that it hits.
    projectile.owner: An integer that represents the index of the player who "owns" the projectile. This is used to determine which player gets credit for killing enemies with the projectile, among other things.
    projectile.timeLeft: An integer that represents the number of frames that the projectile has left to live. When this reaches 0, the projectile will be killed.
    projectile.width and projectile.height: Integers that represent the width and height of the projectile's hitbox, in pixels.
    projectile.alpha: An integer that represents the transparency of the projectile. Higher values make the projectile more transparent.
    projectile.friendly and projectile.hostile: Boolean values that determine whether the projectile can damage friendly (i.e. player-controlled) entities and hostile (i.e. enemy) entities, respectively.
    projectile.ignoreWater: A boolean value that determines whether the projectile can pass through water.
    projectile.tileCollide: A boolean value that determines whether the projectile collides with tiles in the game world. If set to false, the projectile will pass through tiles.
    projectile.netUpdate: A boolean value that determines whether the projectile should be synchronized over the network. If set to false, the projectile will only exist on the local client and will not be visible to other players in multiplayer games.

    int dust = Dust.NewDust(Projectile.Center, 1, 1, DustID.MagicMirror, 0f, 0f, 0, default, 1f); - This line creates a new dust particle at the center of the projectile 
    using the DustID.MagicMirror type. The 1, 1 parameters specify the width and height of the dust particle, 0f, 0f set the initial velocity of the dust to zero,
    and 0 specifies the Type of the dust, which in this case is a default dust type. The default parameter sets the color of the dust to the default color and 1f
    sets the scale of the dust to 1. Finally, the line sets the integer dust to the index of the new dust particle in the Main.dust array.

    Main.dust[dust].noGravity = true; - This line sets the noGravity property of the dust particle referenced by the dust index to true,
    which means that the dust will not be affected by gravity and will continue to float in the air.

    Main.dust[dust].velocity *= 0.3f; - This line multiplies the velocity property of the dust particle referenced by the dust index by 0.3f.
    This means that the dust particle will move slower than its initial velocity.

    Main.dust[dust].scale = Main.rand.Next(100, 135) * 0.013f; - This line sets the scale property of the dust particle referenced by the dust
    index to a random value between 1.3 and 1.8. This value is obtained by multiplying a random integer value between 100 and 135 by 0.013f.

    int dust2 = Dust.NewDust(Projectile.Center, 1, 1, DustID.Shadowflame, 0f, 0f, 0, default, 1f); - This line creates a new dust particle
    at the center of the projectile using the DustID.Shadowflame type. The other parameters have the same meaning as in the first line.

    Main.dust[dust2].noGravity = true; - This line sets the noGravity property of the dust particle referenced by the dust2 index to true.

    Main.dust[dust2].velocity *= 0.3f; - This line multiplies the velocity property of the dust particle referenced by the dust2 index by 0.3f.

    Main.dust[dust2].scale = Main.rand.Next(100, 135) * 0.013f; - This line sets the scale property of the dust particle referenced by the dust2
    index to a random value between 1.3 and 1.8. This value is obtained by multiplying a random integer value between 100 and 135 by 0.013f.
