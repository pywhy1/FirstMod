*In the code WorldGen.genRand.Next(2, 5), WorldGen.genRand.Next(1, 4), the two Next method calls are generating random numbers within specific ranges

The first call WorldGen.genRand.Next(2, 5) generates a random integer between 2 (inclusive) and 5 (exclusive). This number determines the length of the vein of SkulkRareOre being generated

The second call WorldGen.genRand.Next(1, 4) generates a random integer between 1 (inclusive) and 4 (exclusive). This number determines the width of the vein of SkulkRareOre being generated.

This code is checking whether a particular tile at the x, y position is either a SnowBlock, IceBlock, or Slush block,
and if it is, it generates a vein of the SkulkRareOre tile type at that location using the WorldGen.TileRunner method.

The WorldGen.TileRunner method generates a vein of the specified tile type at a given x, y 
position in the world. The first argument is the x position, the second is the y position,
the third and fourth arguments specify the length and width of the vein, and the fifth argument is the tile type to be used for the vein.
